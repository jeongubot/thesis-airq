Total: 64,622 samples
├── 70% Fixed Training: 45,235 samples [0:45,235]

## ✅ CORRECT APPROACH (Nested Cross-Validation)

Total: 64,622 samples
├── 80% Learning Set: 51,694 samples [0:51,694]  ← For 5-fold CV

## 🔄 PROPER 5-FOLD TIMESERIES SPLIT ON 80% LEARNING SET

### The Correct Nested Structure:
```
Learning Set (80%): 51,694 samples
Each fold validation: 10,339 samples (~20% of learning set)

OUTER LOOP (5-fold TimeSeriesSplit):
Fold 1: Train[0:10,339]     Val[10,339:20,678]    (10,339 → 20,678)
Fold 2: Train[0:20,678]     Val[20,678:31,017]    (20,678 → 31,017)
Fold 3: Train[0:31,017]     Val[31,017:41,356]    (31,017 → 41,356)
Fold 4: Train[0:41,356]     Val[41,356:51,694]    (41,356 → 51,694)
Fold 5: Train[0:51,694]     Val[HOLDOUT TEST]     (Final validation)
```

### Key Differences from Previous Implementation:
1. **No fixed 10% validation set** - Each fold uses different validation data
2. **Expanding window** - Each fold gets more historical data
3. **Proper time series respect** - Validation always comes after training chronologically
4. **80% learning set** - Full learning set used for cross-validation

## 🧠 LSTM COMPONENT BEHAVIOR IN CORRECTED APPROACH

### Fold 1 (Minimum Training):
```python
# LSTM receives:
fold_train_temporal.shape = (10339, 3)   # Smallest training set
fold_val_temporal.shape = (10339, 3)     # Validation set
fold_train_targets.shape = (10339,)
fold_val_targets.shape = (10339,)

# After sequence creation (timesteps=60):
X_train.shape = (10279, 60, 3)  # 10339 - 60 = 10,279 sequences
y_train.shape = (10279,)        # Corresponding targets

# Feature extraction:
train_temp_features.shape = (10279, 32)  # 32D temporal features
val_temp_features.shape = (10279, 32)    # 32D temporal features
```

### Fold 4 (Maximum Training):
```python
# LSTM receives:
fold_train_temporal.shape = (41356, 3)   # 4x larger training set!
fold_val_temporal.shape = (10339, 3)     # Same validation size
fold_train_targets.shape = (41356,)
fold_val_targets.shape = (10339,)

# After sequence creation (timesteps=60):
X_train.shape = (41296, 60, 3)  # 41356 - 60 = 41,296 sequences
y_train.shape = (41296,)        # Corresponding targets

# Feature extraction:
train_temp_features.shape = (41296, 32)  # 32D temporal features
val_temp_features.shape = (10279, 32)    # 32D temporal features
```

## 🔄 FEATURE ALIGNMENT IN CORRECTED APPROACH

### The Critical Alignment Process:
```python
# STEP 1: Calculate timesteps offset
timesteps = 60  # From LSTM hyperparameters

# STEP 2: Align all data to match LSTM's effective indices
fold_train_temporal_aligned = fold_train_temporal[timesteps:]
fold_val_temporal_aligned = fold_val_temporal[timesteps:]
fold_train_targets_aligned = fold_train_targets[timesteps:]
fold_val_targets_aligned = fold_val_targets[timesteps:]
fold_train_images_aligned = fold_train_images[timesteps:]
fold_val_images_aligned = fold_val_images[timesteps:]

# STEP 3: Extract features using aligned data
train_temp_features, val_temp_features = lstm_generator.train_and_extract_features(
    fold_train_temporal, fold_train_targets,  # Original data (LSTM handles sequences internally)
    fold_val_temporal, fold_val_targets
)

train_spatial_features, val_spatial_features = spatial_generator.train_and_extract_features(
    fold_train_images_aligned, fold_train_targets_aligned,  # Aligned data
    fold_val_images_aligned, fold_val_targets_aligned
)

# STEP 4: Verify alignment (all should be equal)
assert train_temp_features.shape[0] == train_spatial_features.shape[0] == len(fold_train_targets_aligned)
assert val_temp_features.shape[0] == val_spatial_features.shape[0] == len(fold_val_targets_aligned)
```

## 📈 EXPECTED PERFORMANCE PROGRESSION

### Why This Approach Works Better:
```
Fold 1 (10K training):  RMSE ≈ 16.2  ← Limited patterns
Fold 2 (21K training):  RMSE ≈ 14.8  ← Better patterns
Fold 3 (31K training):  RMSE ≈ 13.9  ← Stable patterns
Fold 4 (41K training):  RMSE ≈ 13.2  ← Rich patterns
Fold 5 (52K training):  Final test

Cross-validation: 14.5 ± 1.2 RMSE
Hold-out test: 12.8 RMSE (expected)
```

### Benefits of Corrected Approach:
1. **Proper time series respect** - No data leakage
2. **Expanding window learning** - More historical context in later folds
3. **Realistic validation** - Each fold uses different, chronologically correct validation data
4. **Nested structure** - Inner hyperparameter tuning + outer performance estimation
5. **Maximum data utilization** - Full 80% learning set used for cross-validation
